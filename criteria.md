# Acceptance criteria — Provenance Guard

Five criteria that say what "working" means for this service, written in unit 7
**before** you built it.

**All five are yours.** None are given.

An acceptance criterion names a number or something plainly observable. *"The
detector is accurate"* is an opinion — and perfect AI detection isn't possible
anyway, so it's an opinion about something nobody can deliver. *"Of 10 pieces I
wrote myself, at most 1 is labelled high-confidence AI"* is a criterion.

Under each, write a sentence or two on **why that target**. *"I allow at most 1
false positive in 10 because on a writing site a wrong accusation costs more
than a missed detection"* is a real answer.

> Missing your own targets next unit costs you nothing. Setting a target so
> easy you can't miss it does.

## Pick numbers you can defend

**Cover at least three of these five areas.** They're prompts, not a form.

| Area | A question it could answer |
|---|---|
| False positives | How often may a human's writing get called AI? |
| Score spread | How far apart should clearly-AI and clearly-human text score? |
| Label coverage | Is every one of your three labels actually reachable? |
| The appeal path | Does an appeal always change status and always get recorded? |
| Bad input | What happens when `text` is missing, empty, or enormous? |

Two things worth knowing before you pick numbers:

- **The expensive mistake is one-sided.** Missing some AI text costs the site a
  little. Accusing a real writer costs that person a lot. A criterion that
  treats both errors as equally bad is describing a system nobody would ship.
- **Unit 8 tests across three trials, and the target has to hold across all
  three.** Your first signal runs a model, so identical input can score
  differently twice. A target of "at most 1 in 10" against trials of 2, 1, 2 is
  a **miss**.

## 1.

Of 10 pieces of text I wrote myself, at most 1 is labeled high-confidence AI.

**Why this target:** Signal one's blind spot (perplexity) penalizes
predictable, plainly-written text regardless of who actually wrote it —
exactly the kind of honest, simple writing a real person produces. The system
has to stay conservative about accusing real writers; the appeal path exists
to catch the rare miss, not to excuse a looser first judgment.

---

## 2.

The combined score for clearly-AI text and clearly-human text differs by at
least 0.3.

**Why this target:** A smaller gap isn't convincing evidence the two signals
are distinguishing anything real — it could just as easily be noise. 0.3 is
large enough that the difference can't be explained away as coincidence.

---

## 3.

I can find at least one real piece of text that produces each of the three
labels — human, unsure, and AI.

**Why this target:** A label that can never actually be produced is a label
that doesn't exist, no matter how the scoring math underneath it was
designed. This has to be checked by submitting real text and observing the
output, not by inspecting the weights — if a label isn't reachable, that's a
scoring bug to fix in Milestone 5, not a detail to note and move past.

---

## 4.

Every appeal changes the submission's status to `under_review` and is
recorded in the audit log. Both happen every time, with no exceptions.

**Why this target:** The appeal is the only recourse a wrongly-accused writer
has. A path that works most of the time is, for the person it fails, the
same as no path at all.

---

## 5.

Missing or empty `text` returns HTTP 400 with a clear error message. Text
over 20,000 characters returns HTTP 413 with a clear error message. Neither
case ever returns a 500.

**Why this target:** A crash on bad input is one of the most common real
failures a service has. Missing data and too much data are different
problems for a caller to fix, so they get different status codes instead of
being lumped into one generic error.

     UNIT 8 — read this before you change anything above.

     If a criterion turns out to be BROKEN rather than merely unmet, you can
     revise it, and that earns credit. But never delete or edit the original
     line. Add the revision underneath, like this:

         ## 2. Uncertain cases land in the unsure band

         The system handles uncertain cases well.

         **Why this target:** ...

         > **Revised in unit 8:** Text I judged borderline scores between
         > 0.4 and 0.6 in at least 4 of 5 cases.
         >
         > **Why revised:** "well" gave me nothing to check. I couldn't
         > reach a verdict from it at all.

     That's a revision because the criterion couldn't be MEASURED.

     Lowering a target because you missed it is not a revision, and it costs
     you the point:

         ✗ "At most 1 of 10 of my own pieces flagged as AI" → "at most 3
            of 10", because 1 of 10 turned out to be hard.

     A number you missed stays where it is, gets diagnosed, and gets a fix
     attempted. That's where the points are.
